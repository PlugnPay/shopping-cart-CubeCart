PlugnPay (API & Smart Screens)

DESCRIPTION:
---------------------------------------
This payment modules allows you to take payments with either the Smart Screens or API PlugnPay integration.
Smart Screens provides a customizable, secure hosted payment form to make integration easy for Web merchants that do not have an SSL certificate.

Payment gateway hosted payment form employs SSL data encryption. Smart Screens uses scripting techniques to authenticate transactions with a unique transaction fingerprint.

The PlugnPay Payment Gateway can handle all the steps in the secure transaction process - payment data collection, data submission and the response to the customer - while keeping PlugnPay virtually transparent.

- Digital fingerprints enhance security, providing multiple layers of authentication.
- Customize the look and feel of the payment gateway hosted payment form and/or receipt page.

API is PlugnPay's recommended connection method and offers the most secure and flexible integration for all types of transactions, including mobile, websites and other business applications.

API allows merchants to host their own secure payment form on a website, mobile device, etc., and send transactions to the payment gateway using an end-to-end secure sockets layer (SSL) connection.

API is also the required connection method for shopping cart developers participating in the PlugnPay Shopping Cart Certification (SCC) program.

- Employs industry standard secure data encryption technology â€” Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
- Uses Remote Client Password authentication for ultimate security.
- Allows control over all phases of the customer's online transaction experience.
